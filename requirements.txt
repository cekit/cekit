# Here are listed only *core* Cekit dependencies that can be installed
# using Python dependency management. Everything else are weak dependencies
# handled by the DependencyHandler class. Any part of Cekit can define dependencies
# and these are evaluated at runtime. If something is not available, execution
# is terminated and user is notified what dependencies are missing.
#
# This is the only way we could satisfy dependency requirements coming from
# various places in different types (Python library, an external tool, a binary).
