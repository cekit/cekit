History
-------

Concreate originates from the `Dogen <https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/dogen>`_ tool. Dogen was developed for over two years and served us well, but we decided to make it a first class citizen and promote using abstract image descriptors. At the same time we wanted to add new set of features which made the "Dockerfile generator" tagline inaccurate and we decided to start fresh under a new project. In any case, this is the Dogen project evolution.
