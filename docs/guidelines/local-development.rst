Local development
==========================

Developing image locally is an important part of the workflow. It needs to provide
a simple way to reference parts of the image we changed. Executing a local build with our
changes should be easily done too.

Module development
--------------------------------

Referencing customized modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CEKit enables you to use a work in progress modules to build the image by using
its overrides system. As an example, imagine we have very simple image which is using
one module from a remote Git repository, like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    schema_version: 1

    name: cekit/example-jdk8
    version: 1.0
    from: centos:7
    description: "JDK 8 image"

    modules:
      repositories:
        # Add a shared module repository located on GitHub. This repository
        # can contain several modules.
        - git:
            name: common
            url: https://github.com/cekit/example-common-module.git
            ref: master

    # Install selected modules (in order)
    install:
      - name: jdk8
      - name: user

Now imagine, we have found a bug in its ``jdk8`` module. We will clone the module
repository locally by executing:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git clone https://github.com/cekit/example-common-module.git ~/repos/example-common-module

Then we will create ``overrides.yaml`` file next to the ``image.yaml`` with following content:

.. code-block:: yaml

  modules:
    repositories:
      - name: common
        path: /home/user/repo/cct_module

Now we can build the image with Docker using overridden module by executing:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cekit build --overrides-file overrides.yaml docker

.. note::
    Instead using an overrides you can use inline overrides too!

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ cekit build --overrides '{"modules": {"repositories": [{"name": "common", "path": "/home/user/repo/cct_module"}]}}' docker

When your work on the module is finished, commit and push your changes to a module repository so that
other can benefit from it. Afterwards you can remove your overrides file and use the upstream version of the module
again.

Notes
^^^^^^

Below you can see suggestions that should make developing modules easier.

Always define name for module repositories
*******************************************

We use the ``name`` key as the resource identifier in all places. If you do not define the ``name``
key yourself, we will generate one for you. This may be handy, but in cases where you plan to use
overrides it may be much better idea to define them.

Lack of the ``name`` key in repositories definition may be problematic because CEKit would not know
which repository should be overrides and instead overriding, a **new module repository will be added**.
This will result in conflicting modules (upstream and custom modules have same name and version) and
thus the build will fail.

Install order of modules matters
**********************************

It is very important to install modules in the proper order.
:ref:`Read more about it here <handbook/modules/merging:Order is important>`.

Besides this, module install order matters at image development time too. If you are going to modify code of some module
installed very early in the process, you should expect that the image build time will be much slower.
Reason for this is that every step below this particular module installation is **automatically invalidated**, cache
cannot be used and needs a full rebuild.

This varies on the selected builder engine, but is especially true for
:ref:`Docker <handbook/building/builder-engines:Docker builder>`.

Injecting local artifacts
----------------------------

During module/image development there can be a need to use locally built artifact instead of a released one.
The easiest way to inject such artifact is to use override mechanism.

Imagine that you have an artifact defined in following way:

.. code-block:: yaml

    artifacts:
        - name: jolokia
          md5: d31c6b1525e6d2d24062ef26a9f639a8
          url: https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/org/jolokia/jolokia-jvm/1.5.0.redhat-1/jolokia-jvm-1.5.0.redhat-1-agent.jar

You want to inject a local build of new version of our artifact. To archive it you need to create following override:

.. code-block:: yaml

    artifacts:
        - name: jolokia
          path: /tmp/build/jolokia.jar

Please note that the ``name`` key is used to identify which artifact we are going to override.

Whenever you override artifact, all previous checksums are removed too. If you want your new artifact to
pass integrity checks you need to define checksum also in overrides in a following way:

.. code-block:: yaml

    artifacts:
        - name: jolokia
          md5: d31c6b1525e6d2d24062ef26a9f639a8
          path: /tmp/build/joloika.jar
