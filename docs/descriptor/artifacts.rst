``artifacts``
-------------

It's common for images to require external artifacts.
In most cases you will want to add files into the image and use them at
the image build process.

Artifacts section is meant exactly for this. *Cekit will automatically
fetch any artifacts* specified in this section
and check their consistency by computing checksum of
the downloaded file and comparing it with the desired value. The output name
for downloaded resources will match the ``name`` attribute, which defaults to
the base name of the file/URL. Artifact locations may be specified as ``url``\s,
``path``\s or ``git`` references.

.. note::

   If you are using relative ``path`` to define an artifact, path is considered relative to an
   image descriptor which introduced that artifact.
   
   **Example**: If an artifact is defined inside */foo/bar/image.yaml* with a path: *baz/1.zip*
   the artifact will be resolved as */foo/bar/baz/1.zip*

.. code:: yaml

    artifacts:
          # File will be downloaded and verified.
        - name: jolokia-1.3.6-bin.tar.gz
          url: https://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/releases/download/v1.3.6/jolokia-1.3.6-bin.tar.gz
          md5: 75e5b5ba0b804cd9def9f20a70af649f

          # File exists on local machine relative to this file. Checksum will be verified.
          # The "name" attribute defaults to: "hawkular-javaagent-1.0.0.CR4-redhat-1-shaded.jar"
        - path: local-artifacts/hawkular-javaagent-1.0.0.CR4-redhat-1-shaded.jar
          md5: e133776c76a474ed46ac88c856eabe34

          # git project will be cloned
          # "name" attribute defaults to "project"
        - git:
              url: https://github.com/organization/project
              ref: master

.. note::

    Currently supported algorithms are: md5, sha1 and sha256. If no algorithm is provided, artifact will
    be fetched **every** time.

For artifacts that are not publicly available Cekit provides a way to
add a description detailing a location from which the artifact can be obtained.

.. code:: yaml

    artifacts:
        - path: jboss-eap-6.4.0.zip
          md5: 9a5d37631919a111ddf42ceda1a9f0b5
          description: "Red Hat JBoss EAP 6.4.0 distribution available on Customer Portal: https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDetail.html?softwareId=37393&product=appplatform&version=6.4&downloadType=distributions"

If Cekit is not able to download an artifact and this artifact has a ``description`` defined -- the build
will fail but a message with the description will be printed together with information on where to place
the manually downloaded artifact.
