Every image can include arg instructions. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg for more
details. CEKit makes it easy to do so with the ``args`` section. An optional default value may be provided.

.. note::

    ARGS will be rendered before any environment variables, labels or execution sections.
