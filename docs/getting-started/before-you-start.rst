Before you start
=================

Please ensure that you have followed the installation instructions that may be found :doc:`here </handbook/installation/index>`.

This guide will work through the following example repositories:

* https://github.com/cekit/example-image-tomcat/
* https://github.com/cekit/example-common-module/

While several different build engines to construct container images are supported, this guide will use
the :doc:`podman </handbook/building/builder-engines>` engine.
