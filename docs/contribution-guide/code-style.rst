Code style
=========================

In case you contribute code, we generally ask for following the code style we are using already.
This is a general Python style, with 4 spaces as the delimiter, nothing groundbreaking here :)

Formatting
-----------

For code formatting we use `Flake8 <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`__. You can find a ``.flake8``
configuration file in the root directory.

Linting
-----------

Additionally we check for code errors with `Pylint <https://www.pylint.org/>`__. We provide a
``.pylintrc`` file in the root directory which defines differences from the default
Pylint configuration. Your IDE may help with linting your code too!
