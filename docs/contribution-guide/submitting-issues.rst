Submitting issues
=========================

Our main issue tracker can be found here: https://github.com/cekit/cekit/issues. This is the best place to report any issues with
CEKit. Usually we divide tickets into two categories:

#. Bug reports
#. Enhancements

To make it much easier for you to submit a ticket we created templates for you: https://github.com/cekit/cekit/issues/new/choose.
Of course if you have non-standard request, feel free to open a regular issue here: https://github.com/cekit/cekit/issues/new.

.. note::
    We strongly suggest using our templates, because it tries to formalize a bit the reporting process which helps us
    review new tickets.

Labels
-----------

We use labels to categorize issues.

Each ticket has assigned three label categories:

* :kbd:`type/`
* :kbd:`priority/`
* :kbd:`complexity/`

There can be other labels assigned of course too!

Labels are set by the template or by CEKit team members. Initial labels (after a ticket is created) are assigned after triage which is
done ad-hoc by CEKit team members.

Milestones
-----------

We use `milestones <https://github.com/cekit/cekit/milestones>`__ to group images that should go to a particular release. Assigning a milestone
to a ticket does not mean that it will be fixed in that particular milestone. This is mostly a hint for developer (and the reported)
what is the proposed milestone.

Tickets can be moved to different milestones at any time.

Boards
-----------

To have a better overview on the release we use `boards <https://github.com/orgs/cekit/projects>`__ (aka GitHub projects). Some of them are long-living,
but some of them are targeting specific milestone. Usually we use Kanban-style boards.
